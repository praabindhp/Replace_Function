She came to us having worked with a different technology set. She setup a time with me to go over what was a requirement and what was nice to have and then sat in the first few interviews to get an even better understanding of what I was looking for. After that, she added technical questions to her screen which helped weed out some of the candidates. Sarah screened resumes and forwarded candidates that looked like good fits, went through LinkedIn profiles with me to look for candidates when we felt that the resumes we were receiving were not strong enough. Finally, when we did decide on the first hire, we unfortunately ended up in a temporary hiring freeze, but that didn't deter her. She stayed in touch with the potential hire through out the time and brought them on-board as soon as freeze ended. She was instrumental in bringing both eventual hires on-board. And the end of all of it, she was poached by a different team. Sarah is smart, tenacious and is not afraid to challenge herself to learn new technologies to be effective in her role.
